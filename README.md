# ASCOM.Stroblhofwarte.Rotator

**** PLEASE use tag v1.0.0 for the hardware version described below *****

**** The master branch contains a development version for a hardware version without zero position switch ****

**** Development: Derotation for Alt/Az mounts ****
Derotation formula: Field Rotation Rate (arcsec/sec) = R =  15.04 (deg/hr) COS(Latitude)*COS(Azimuth Angle) / COS(Altitude Angle)

The Stroblhof Rotator is a simple and sturdy rotator device
for astronomical observations. It could be build without access to
a lathe or milling machine. 

![Rotator](https://github.com/stroblhofwarte/ASCOM.Stroblhofwarte.Rotator/blob/master/Rotator.jpg )

The rotator device is made out of aluminium
and steel. It is driven by a NEMA 14 stepper motor. The rotator could 
rotate (approximately) between between 0째 and 359.9째. It will never rotate more than one revolution to prevent tangled cords. 
The electronics are made out of a arduino uno and a shield with TMC2130 driver.
Each Pololu compatible stepper driver can be used, the TMC2130 driver supports 16 microsteps and is the best choice
for silent operation. 
The communication between this driver and the arduino is done with a simple
serial protocol, 9600 baud. A command ends with
a colon (:), the response ends with a hash (#).
